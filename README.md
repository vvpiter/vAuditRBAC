vAuditRBAC - Policy-Driven RBAC Compliance for vCenter Servers

Ensure your vCenter environment adheres to defined RBAC policies with vAuditRBAC, an automated compliance tool. It compares live roles and permissions in vCenter against a centrally defined policy stored in GitHub or Confluence and reports any mismatches in privileges, assignments, or propagation levels.
